The parser viewParser.js has been generated by PEGJS v0.8.0 through the specification in viewParser.pejs.

To achieve the same, run the following commands:

```
npm install -g pegjs
pegjs viewParser.pejs
```

**Since the specification contains a little hack, it could be that the same specification does not work with other versions of PEGJS.**
