How to compile
--------------

AnyMemo is built using gradle. You need to make sure the following are installed in
order to build:
* Android SDK tools: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
* JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

In Android SDK tools' "Android SDK Manager", you need the following items:
* Android 4.1.x SDK platform
* Android SDK tools
* Andoird SDK Build-tools version 19
* Android support repository
* Android support library

Once the dependency is satisfied, you need to set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable
to the Android SDK installation location. E. g.

$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk-linux/


cd to the AnyMemo directory and Use gradle to compile the project

Move AMSecrets.java.template in src/org/liberty/android/fantastischmemo to AMSecrets.
Provide the values to the fields in AMSecrets.java.

Them compile using gradle:
$ cd anymemo
$ ./gradlew assembleFreeDebug
To build pro version, use
$ ./gradlew assembleProDebug

The build artifacts are in
build/apk/

Instrumentation tests
---------------------
There are hundreds of intrumentation tests that ensure the basic funciton of
AnyMemo. To run these tests against free version, you need to run:
$ ./gradlew installFreeDebugTest
$ ./gradlew connectedInstrumentTestFreeDebug

To run against pro version:
$ ./gradlew installProDebugTest
$ ./gradlew connectedInstrumentTestProDebug


Eclipse users
-------------

For the eclipse user, the gradle is not supported to build. However you can
still use eclipse to edit the project with auto completion fully working.

* Build the project using gradle
* mv eclipse-deps/classpath-template .classpath
* mv eclipse-deps/project-template .project
* Import project in eclipse as "Java Project". Do not import as Android project.
  ADT is not needed at all!

Known issue:
The aspectj will not work correctly.

Android studio user
-------------------

It is easy! Install all the dependencies listed in the "How to compile" section
and you can import directly into Android studio.
